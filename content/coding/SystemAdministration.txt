Linux files have permissions

  Each inode in Linux keeps track of which people can do which things to it

  The things a person can do to a file:

   * Read it
   * Write to it
   * Execute it

  The relationships a person can have to a file:
  * Owner of the file
  * Share a group with the file
  * Other (not the owner or in a group with it)

What is an inode?

  An inode is a file or a directory

  A directory is sometimes also called a folder

What is a symlink?

  A symlink is a special type of file that points to another file.

  When a program reads from or writes to a symlink, it usually will instead read from or write to the file that the symlink points to.

Filesystem directory hierarchy

  Files in a computer are organized into directories (also known as folders).
  Each directory may contain files or directories
  Each file or directory can be accessed by its absolute path.

How to see the permissions of a file

  To see the permissions of a file, you can do `ls -la <filename>`

  This might output something like this:

  ```
   $ ls -la example.sh
  -rwxrw-r-- 1 gasto gasto 0 Sep 13 19:01 example.sh
  ```

  There are 9 characters of permission information in this output.
  1. Three characters describe permissions for the owner

      The initial `rwx` means that the owner of the file can read it, write to it, and execute it

  1. Three characters describe permissions for users that share a group with the file

      The `rw-` means that other users in the same group as the file can read or write the file but not execute it

  1. Three characters describe permissions for other users

    The `r--` means that other users can read the file but not write it or execute it

How to change the permissions of a file

  To change the permissions of a file, you can use `chmod <who><addOrRemove><permission> <file>`

  `who` can be 'u' for the owner, 'g' for users in the same group, or 'o' for other users

  `addOrRemove` should be '+' or '-'

  `permission` can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, or 'x' for executing.

  For example, to allow the owner of a file to execute it, do `chmod u+x <file>`

How to change the owner of a file

  To change the owner of a file, you can use `chown <newOwner> <file>`

Why should I change the permissions of a file?

  * Security
      * It's possible that an untrustworthy person might get permission to log in to a system as a certain user
          * Maybe that person was given an account
          * Maybe that person acquired someone else's login credentials
          * Maybe that person found and took advantage of a security problem in another service running on the machine
      * If most login accounts don't have permissions to do most things, then it prevents an attacker from easily taking over the entire system

  * Bugs
      * If a program has a bug in it, it might accidentally try to modify or delete files that it's not supposed to. If it doesn't have permission to do this, it won't succeed in doing it.

  * Mistakes
      * If you accidentally type a harmful command into the terminal (for example a command that specifies to delete all files on the system), it would be nice for that command to fail rather than cause a problem
      * A common way to prevent this kind of thing is to remove your own permissions for taking these unwanted actions
      * If you later decide you do want to allow yourself to do these things anyway, you might have to switch accounts or modify the permissions of the file to allow yourself to modify it

What is a port in networking?

  A port is an identifier that is used in routing traffic to a program on a computer.

  When someone starts a service, the service has to decide which port to listen on.

  When you access a service on another computer, your computer must know which port it is listening on.

  Two services cannot listen on the same port.

  The default port for web servers to listen on is port 80.

  The default port for an ssh server to listen on is port 22.

How can I run a Jupyter Notebook on a workstation from my laptop?

  On the workstation terminal, run `jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080` (if someone else is already using this port, choose another port).

  On my laptop terminal, run `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 <username>@<computer>`

  On my laptop chrome, open http://localhost:8080/

Why using Jupyter Notebook?

  I like Jupyter Notebook because it allows me to test a small session of code individually, without restarting the entire process (different than `python WHOLE_PROCESS.py`).

  It's also highly interactive that I can check and visualize the intermediate results easily :)

What is Jupyter Notebook?

  Jupyter Notebook is a web-based tool that allows us to run live code and visualizations.

  It supports various programming languages, such as Python, R, and Julia.

  You can install Jupyter Notebook by `pip install jupyter` or `conda install -c conda-forge notebook`

  You can run Jupyter Notebook by `jupyter notebook`

How can I ssh into another computer?

  To ssh into another computer, type `ssh <username>@<computer>`

  This requires that `sshd` is running on the computer you want to connect to

  When you're done, you can type `exit` to exit

 - Getting ssh credentials
 - Inspecting a computer process

Getting ssh credentials

  ssh accepts two types of credentials

  * username and password

  * ssh keys

 - Getting an ssh username and password
 - Enabling ssh keys

Enabling ssh keys

  Allowing someone to access a computer via ssh requires:

  * Making an ssh key pair

  * Asking the computer to trust this key pair by copying the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

  * Making sure that `sshd` is running

 - Getting ssh keys

Getting an ssh username and password

  When creating a Linux account via `adduser`, the ssh username and password should be the same as the account username and password, if username and password is enabled.

  Note that using an ssh password is likely to be less convenient than an ssh key, and is also generally considered to be less secure

Getting ssh keys

  To generate an ssh key, you can run `ssh-keygen`.

 - What is an ssh key?

What is an ssh key?

  An ssh key is a pair of files that allow you to demonstrate your identity to others.

  One file is your private key which contains some secret text that is known only to you or your computer.

  One file is your public key which can be used to verify the information in the private key.

  * The name of this file should end with ".pub"

  ssh keys are verified in [a clever way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) so that it's not necessary to share the contents of your private key to demonstrate your identity.

What is ssh?

  SSH stands for Secure Shell.

  It lets you run commands on another computer that you enter into your own computer.

  SSH is a type of shell.

What is my hostname?

  To get your computer's hostname, run `hostname -a` in a terminal

  To determine whether your computer can reach a certain ip address, run `ping <address>` or `ping <hostname>` in a terminal

  On Linux, run `ipconfig`

 - What is an ip address?

What is an ip address?

  An ip address is a way for computers to refer to each other on a network.

  IPv4 addresses look like four numbers separated by dots, for example:

  `127.0.0.1`

How can I copy a file to or from another computer?

  You can copy a file to or from another computer using `scp`

  To send a file from your computer to another, run `scp <filepath> <remoteUsername>@<remoteHost>:<remotePath>` in a local shell

  To get a file from another computer to yours, run `scp <remoteUsername>@<remoteHost>:<remotePath> <filepath>` in a local shell

  If this doesn't work, check whether you can `ssh` into that computer

What is local in a computer?

  "Local" refers to a computer that you can physically access or information in that computer, rather than something behind a network.

  The device your are looking at now is considered local.

  The server that hosts JeffsKnowledgeGraph is not local; it is remote.
