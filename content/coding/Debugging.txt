Inspecting a process on Linux

  If you have a terminal which is not running anything, you can use it to inspect other programs.

  To view a dynamic list of which programs are using the most cpu time, you can run `top`. You may also be able to run `htop`

  To view a list of all programs, you can run `ps -ef`

Cancelling a process on Linux

  If you ran a command in the terminal that is still running, usually you can press Ctrl-C to quit it.

  If that doesn't help, you can cancel the program using the `kill` command

    You should be able to get the process id of `commandName` by running `ps -ef | grep <commandName>`

    When you know the id of the process, you can do `kill <processId>` to ask the process to terminate

    If that doesn't work and you are sure that you want to terminate the process right away, you can do `kill 9 <processId>` to terminate the process

Inspecting a process on Windows

  You can press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to open the Task Manager which lists which programs are running and how much memory and cpu they are using

What is a computer process?

  A process is a running instance of a computer program

  It has instructions and arguments.

  For example, running `ls /tmp` in a terminal will create a new process running `ls` with one argument, `/tmp`.

What to do about a slow command?

  If a computer process is slow but not stuck, here are some things you can do about it

  * Make it faster
      * This is easier if it is your own program

  * Parallelism
      * If the computer it is running on has extra resources available, you can try to increase the parallelism: either asking the program to use more threads, or directly running more copies of the program at once

  * Incrementalism
      * If the program might not finish all of its work at once, you can try to make sure that the program supports incrementalism so that if it is resumed, it doesn't have to repeat that work

  * Notifications
      * You can set up a notification to tell you when it is done so you can know when it's done even without checking it so often

Memory vs storage

  Computer memory is very fast, but it is expensive and is reset when the computer loses power.

  Computer storage (also referred to as disk) is slower and keeps its information when the computer loses power.

  Computers usually have more storage than memory.

  Memory is usually used for processes that are running

  Storage is usually used for holding files.
