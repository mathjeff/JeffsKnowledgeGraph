Inspecting a process on Linux

  If you have a terminal which is not running anything, you can use it to inspect other programs.

  To view a dynamic list of which programs are using the most cpu time, you can run `top`. You may also be able to run `htop`

  To view a list of all programs, you can run `ps -ef`

Cancelling a process on Linux

  If you ran a command in the terminal that is still running, usually you can press Ctrl-C to quit it.

  If that doesn't help, you can cancel the program using the `kill` command

    You should be able to get the process id of `commandName` by running `ps -ef | grep <commandName>`

    When you know the id of the process, you can do `kill <processId>` to ask the process to terminate

    If that doesn't work and you are sure that you want to terminate the process right away, you can do `kill 9 <processId>` to terminate the process
