Inspecting a process on Linux

  If you have a terminal which is not running anything, you can use it to inspect other programs.

  To view a dynamic list of which programs are using the most cpu time, you can run `top`. You may also be able to run `htop`

  To view a list of all programs, you can run `ps -ef`

Cancelling a process on Linux

  If you ran a command in the terminal that is still running, usually you can press Ctrl-C to quit it.

  If that doesn't help, you can cancel the program using the `kill` command

    You should be able to get the process id of `commandName` by running `ps -ef | grep <commandName>`

    When you know the id of the process, you can do `kill <processId>` to ask the process to terminate

    If that doesn't work and you are sure that you want to terminate the process right away, you can do `kill -9 <processId>` to terminate the process

Inspecting a process on Windows

  You can press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to open the Task Manager which lists which programs are running and how much memory and cpu they are using

What is a computer process?

  A process is a running instance of a computer program

  It has instructions and arguments.

  For example, running `ls /tmp` in a terminal will create a new process running `ls` with one argument, `/tmp`.

What to do about a slow command?

  If a computer process is slow but not stuck, here are some things you can do about it

  * Make it faster
      * This is easier if it is your own program

  * Parallelism
      * If the computer it is running on has extra resources available, you can try to increase the parallelism: either asking the program to use more threads, or directly running more copies of the program at once

  * Incrementalism
      * If the program might not finish all of its work at once, you can try to make sure that the program supports incrementalism so that if it is resumed, it doesn't have to repeat that work

  * Notifications
      * You can set up a notification to tell you when it is done so you can know when it's done even without checking it so often

Memory vs storage

  Computer memory is very fast, but it is expensive and is reset when the computer loses power.

  Computer storage (also referred to as disk) is slower and keeps its information when the computer loses power.

  Computers usually have more storage than memory.

  Memory is usually used for processes that are running

  Storage is usually used for holding files.

Debugging complicated systems via binary search simplification

  If you have a complicated system that is doing something you don't understand, one way to understand it better is to simplify the system.

  For example, if you have a computer program that has a bug, you can remove part of the computer program and see if it still has the same bug.

  * If the program still has the same bug, then the problem is somewhere in the remaining part of the program
  * If the program no longer has the same bug, then something about the code that you removed was important for observing the bug

 - Examining a project's source code

What is a computer bug?

  A bug in software engineering is a mistake or error in a program that causes it to work incorrectly under some circumstances.

Learning about complicated systems via version control

  If you have a complicated system that you would like to learn about, one approach for understanding it better is to look at changes that have been made to its source code recently.

  You can discover:

  * What changes have been made
      * If two different versions of a program do different things, this should be due to changes in the programs or their datasets
      * If you know what changes have been made between two versions of a program it can be easier to determine why they behave differently
  * Which source files have been changed together
      * Files that are changed together are more likely to be related

Learning about complicated systems via string search and links

  If you have a complicated system that you would like to learn about, one approach for understanding it better is to search through its source code for terms that you recognize and then follow some links.

  If your system displays any words onscreen, you can search through its source code for those words to make some guesses about where in the source code those words come from.

  Then, you can look for other parts of the system that interact with those parts of the system, and repeat, until you find something that looks helpful

Examining source code history via git

  Git has many features. One useful feature is to view the history of a specific file via `git log -p <filename>`

What to do about 'No space left on device'

  A Linux command may say 'No space left on device' if the corresponding partition is full

  It should also specify which filepath it tried to write to

 - Which partition is my file in?
 - Freeing drive space on a computer

Freeing drive space on a computer

  If you want to free some space on your computer, first identify which partition you want to free some space in.

  Then, identify which directories in the partition are using a substantial amount of space.

  Finally, for large files or directories, do one of:
  * If nobody will ever need it, you can delete it
  * If you have another copy on your computer, consider removing one and just using the other one
      * You can update the program that uses one file to instead use the other file
      * You can replace one file with a symlink pointing at the other file
  * If you don't need it often and can get it from somewhere else (like the internet), consider deleting it
  * If you don't need it often, consider compressing it
  * If you have another partition with more space, consider moving it to that other partition

 - What is using space on my drive?
 - How can I make a symlink?
 - How can I compress a file or directory?

What is using space on my drive?

  To see how much space is being used by files in a directory, run `du`

  To see the total for that directory, add `-c`

  To see convenient human-readable suffixes (kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes), add `-h`

  To limit the summary to just immediate subdirectories, add `--max-depth 1`

  Combining the above:
  * `du -ch --max-depth 1` will give a summary of what is using space in the working directory

  To get more information about a specific subdirectory, you can run `cd <subdirectory>` and run the same `du` command again
