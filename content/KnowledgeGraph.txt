# Information about this knowledge graph itself

What is Jeff's Knowledge Graph?

  This is Jeff's Knowledge Graph!

  It is:

    * A prototype/experimental collection of information
    * Originally populated with things that Jeff knows
    * Organized to make it easy to skip to what you're interested in
        * The idea is:
            * We've written down some information
            * Each piece of information is pretty short
            * For each piece of information, we have:
                * Written down what you should know before reading about it
                * Categorized it a little bit to make it easier to find
            * This web page keeps track of what you know and what you're interested in
            * This web page tries to use this information to make it easy to jump to what you should read next.
                * Various topics have several types of outgoing links to other topics ranging from much simpler to much more advanced
                * Outgoing links are color-coded based on type

    * Different from a usual [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph)
        * Most other knowledge graphs are organized such that each node is an entity
        * In Jeff's Knowledge Graph, each node tries to be a statement or other small piece of knowledge
