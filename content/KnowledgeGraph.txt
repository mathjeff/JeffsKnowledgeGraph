# Information about this knowledge graph itself

What is Jeff's Knowledge Graph?

  This is Jeff's Knowledge Graph!

  It's an organized collection of information, originally populated with things that Jeff knows.

  The idea is:

    * People want to learn some certain things that they don't know
    * Learning some things requires learning other things first
    * People don't want to read again about things that they already know about
