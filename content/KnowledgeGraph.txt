What is Jeff's Knowledge Graph?

  This is Jeff's Knowledge Graph!

  It is:

    * A prototype/experimental collection of information
    * Originally populated with things that Jeff knows
    * Organized to make it easy to skip to what you're interested in
        * The idea is:
            * We've written down some information
            * For each piece of information, we've written down what you should know before reading about it
            * This web page keeps track of what you know and what you're interested in
            * This web page tries to use this information to make it easy to jump to what you should read next.
                * Various topics have several types of outgoing links to other topics ranging from much simpler to much more advanced
                * Outgoing links are color-coded based on complexity
