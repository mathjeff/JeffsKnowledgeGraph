P-hacking

  P-hacking is a certain type of mistake in estimating the probability that a certain pattern in the data may have happened by chance. It entails doing this:

  1. Look for several different possible patterns that might occur in a dataset
  1. For each pattern, independently compute the probability that it may have occurred by chance
  1. Select the pattern that was least likely to have happened by chance
  1. Report that the probability of this pattern having happened by chance was exactly the number you just computed

  This is a mistake because if you compute lots of independent random probabilities, it is likely that one will be small just because there are many of them.

  An example of p-hacking can be found in [this xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/882/).

  To avoid p-hacking, a person can correct for this by taking into account [FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate).

 - What is a p-value?

What is a p-value?

  A p-value represents the probability that a specific property of a specific dataset could have been produced by chance.

  A p-value is produced by a statistical test.

Cross validation

  Cross validation is a way of estimating the error rate of a mathematical model

  Suppose you have a model that can be trained on any number of datapoints

  Suppose you have N datapoints available

  Suppose you want to estimate the error rate of this model outside of your N datapoints.

  Cross validation entails doing this:

  1. Split the N datapoints into a training group and a testing group. For example, you can use N-1 datapoints for training and 1 datapoint for testing.
  1. Train the model on the training datapoints
  1. Compute the error rate on the test datapoints
  1. Split the datapoints in a different way and repeat until every datapoint has been part of exactly one testing group.
  1. Compute the average error rate of each of the above results and use that as an estimate of the overall error rate of the model

  Is this estimate correct?
   * We assume that the error rate of training a model with more datapoints won't be more than the error rate of training a model with fewer datapoints.
       * This suggests that the error rate of a model trained on all datapoints is no more than the error rate of many of the individual models trained on fewer datapoints
   * Every one of these individual error estimates should be an unbiased estimate of the error rate of its particular model, because its training an testing set are independent
   * These individual estimates aren't necessarily independent from each other, though
       * So, the standard deviation of the resulting estimate isn't necessarily low: the true error rate can still be substantially different from the estimated error rate.

  Why would we do this?
   * Obtaining datapoints can be difficult
   * Training a model may require many datapoints
   * Testing a model may require many datapoints
   * Cross-validation can prevent us from having to acquire so many datapoints

Independence

  Two variables are independent if conditioning on the value of A does not cause any change to the probability distribution associated with B and vice versa.

  -> P(A|B) = P(A)

  -> P(A,B) = P(B|A)*P(A) = P(B)*P(A)

  Interestingly, two variables (e.g. broken bones and lung cancer) can be independent in general but become dependent when conditioning on a third variable (e.g. being in the hospital).

  And conversely, two dependent random variables (e.g. shoe size and reading level in primariy school) can become independent upon conditioning on a third variable (e.g. age). This often happens when two otherwise unrelated events have a common cause.

 - Probability VS statistics

Conditional probabilities

  Probability associated with the event B = b, once we condition on the fact A = a took place.

  -> P(B = b | A = a) = P(A = a, B = b)/P(A = a)

  -> P(A = a, B = b) = P(B = b | A = a)*P(A = a) or P(A,B) = P(B|A)*P(A) = P(A|B)*P(B)

 - Probability VS statistics

Probability VS statistics

  Probabilities are theoretical quantities that underly the data generating process (e.g. P = 0.5 to get heads when toss a coin).

  Statistics are empirical quantities that are computed as functions of the observed data (e.g. 48 heads in 100 tosses).
