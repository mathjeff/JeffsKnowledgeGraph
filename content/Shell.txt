  There are several ways to search the history of a terminal

  - Terminal reverse search
  - Terminal history command
  - SessionManager

Terminal reverse search

  In a terminal, you can press "Ctrl-R" and type some text to search for earlier instances where you typed that command

What is the format of a shell command?

  A shell command can be one of:

    A program and some arguments
    The first word is the program name, and subsequent words are arguments

      For example in the command `echo hi there`:
        `echo` is the command
        `hi` is the first argument
        `there` is the second argument

      When a user runs `echo hi there`, the shell will run the `echo` command and pass it "hi" as the first argument and "there" as the second argument".
      This will cause the shell to output the text "hi there".

    Multiple other shell commands joined by something else

How do I join shell commands inline?

  You can join shell commands in several ways.

  If you want to wait for the first command to complete, and only if it succeeds you want to run the second command, you can use '&&'. For example:

    echo a && echo b

  If you want to wait for the first command to complete, and run the second command regardless of its success or failure status, you can use '||'. For example:

    stat /nonexistent || echo b

  If you want to run both commands at the same time and use the output of one as the input of the other, you can use '|'. For example:

    echo abcdefg | grep --color b

Terminal tab complete

  When typing a filepath in the terminal, you can press `tab` to autocomplete a filename

  For example, if you have an empty directory with a file named "sample", you can type "echo sa" and press the tab key, and the terminal should autocomplete to say "echo sample"

  - Terminal directories
  - What is a shell?

Terminal new directory

  To make a new directory in the terminal, type `mkdir <somedir>`

  For example, you can type `mkdir sample` to make an empty dir called "sample"

  - Terminal directories

Terminal directories

  Files in a computer are organized into directories (also known as folders).
  Each directory may contain files or directories (or even symlinks).
  Each file or directory can be accessed by its absolute path.
  An absolute path is a string starting with "/".

    For example, "/tmp" is an absolute path.
    To see the contents of the `/tmp` directory, you can run `ls /tmp`.

  A relative path is a string that doesn't start with "/". A relative path can be converted into an absolute path by starting at another directory, called the working directory, and following the relative path.

  Each program in a computer has a working directory which essentially refers to whichever directory it is currently looking at.

    For example, "tmp" is a relative path.
    Also, "example" is a relative path.
    If the working directory is `/` and you want to check whether the file `/tmp/example` exists, you can run either `ls tmp/example` or `ls /tmp/example` to check.
    If the working directory is `/tmp` and you want to check whether the file `/tmp/example` exists, you can run either `ls example` or `ls /tmp/example` to check.

  To see the working directory, you can run `pwd`

  To change the working directory, you can run `cd <someNewDir>`

Terminal copy

  When there is text on the screen in your terminal, you can copy it!

    On Linux, press Ctrl-Shift-C.
      Don't accidentally just press Ctrl-C . That will cancel the current command
    On Mac, press Apple-C
    On Windows, press Ctrl-Insert

  - What is a shell?

Terminal paste

  You can paste text into your terminal that you previously copied

    On Linux, press Ctrl-Shift-V
    On Mac, press Apple-V
    On Windows, press Shift-Insert

  - Terminal copy

Shell functions

  If you feel that you are doing too much typing in your terminal, you can create functions to do things for you.

  To declare a function, write something like this:

  ```
    function hello() {
      echo hi
    }
  ```

  You can put this text into your terminal initialization script if you want it to persist.

  - Shell initialization scripts

Shell initalization scripts

  When a shell starts, it runs one or more initialization scripts.
  On Linux, this path is usually ~/.bashrc for interactive sessions (like the terminal)
  On Cygwin in Windows, this is the same as in Linux
  On Mac, this path is usually ~/.bashrc for Bash or ~/.zshrc for Zsh

  You can make modifications to these files if you want to change behavior or add features to your terminal

  If you modify one of these files and want to apply the new file to your current shell, you can source it

    For example, if you modify ~/.bashrc you could run `source ~/.bashrc`

    This reruns the entire file
