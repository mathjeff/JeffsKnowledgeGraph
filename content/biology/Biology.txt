How can phage therapy be helpful?

  Phage therapy can potentially fight pathogenic bateria, even when those bacteria are resistant to antibiotics

  Phage therapy can also avoid harming non-pathogenic bacteria

How can non-pathogenic bacteria be good?

  Non-pathogenic bacteria can discourage pathogens from colonizing the human body

  Non-pathogenic bacteria in the gut can help with digestion
