What is phage therapy?

  Phage therapy is the idea of using a bacteriophage to help a human to fight bacteria

 - What is a bacteriophage?

 - What is a bacteria?

How can phage therapy be helpful?

  Phage therapy can potentially fight pathogenic bateria, even when those bacteria are resistant to antibiotics

  Phage therapy can also avoid harming non-pathogenic bacteria

 - What is antibiotic resistance?

 - How can non-pathogenic bacteria be good?

How can non-pathogenic bacteria be good?

  Non-pathogenic bacteria can discourage pathogens from colonizing the human body

  Non-pathogenic bacteria in the gut can help with digestion

What are antibiotics?

  Antibiotics are molecules that are more dangerous to many bacteria than they are dangerous to humans (bleach isn't considered an antibiotic because it's also dangerous to human cells).

 - What is a bacteria?

How can antibiotics be helpful?

  Antibiotics are useful for killing pathogenic bacteria that have infected a human

 - What are antibiotics?

 - What is a pathogen?

What is a pathogen?

  A pathogen is an entity that causes disease

What is antibiotic resistance?

  Antibiotic resistance is the property where a bacteria resists an antibiotic

What is a bacteria?

  A bacteria is a small organism that consumes energy and reproduces

What is a bacteriophage?

  A [bacteriophage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage) is a type of virus that infects bacteria and archaea

 - What is a virus?

 - What is a bacteria?

What is a virus?

  A virus is a small entity that:

   1. Contains DNA or RNA
   1. Attemps to infect a living cell
   1. Gets living cells to make more copies of it
   1. Leaves that living cell
   1. Repeats the process again

What is a genetic variant?

  Genetic variants are differences in DNA sequences.

  Genetic variants include:

    * Point mutations: single base changes in the DNA sequence

    * Indels: insertion or deletion of a small DNA segment

    * Structural changes: deletion, duplication, or inversions of a long genome region

How do point mutations occur?

  Point mutations usually happen when cells are replicating their DNA: sometimes those cells make small errors and create another genome that isn't an exact duplicate of the original.

  Typical mutation rates:

    * For bacteria: 1E-9 to 1E-10 mutations per nucleotide per generation

    * For human: 1E-8 mutations per nucleotide per generation

    * For RNA viruses: 1E-3 to 1E-5 mutations per nucleotide per generation

What is evolution?

  Evolution is the process by which living organisms change over time through changes in the genome.

  Evolution happens because:
  * Different organisms have their own genetic variants
  * Different organisms survive differently
  * Organisms pass their genetic changes on to the next generation

 - What is a genetic variant?

 - What is natural selection?

What is natural selection?

  Natural selection is the idea that organisms with beneficial genetic changes reproduce more successfully or survive better (positive selection), while those with harmful genetic changes reproduce less effectively (negative selection).

What is a selective sweep?

  A selective sweep is the process where a beneficial genetic change increases to almost 100% frequency in a population, due to positive selection.

  The neighboring genetic changes (variants) can also increase in frequency because they are next to the beneficial genetic changes (hitchhiking).

  Genetic changes that are far away from the beneficial changes are less likely to hitchhike because recombination is more likely to occur in the genomic region between them.

 - What is natural selection?

 - What is recombination?

What is recombination?

  Recombination is the process by which DNA is exchanged between homologous portions of two genomes.

  * In eukaryotes, this DNA is exchanged between chromosomes during cell replication.

  * Bacteria

      * Exchange DNA through horizontal gene transfer.

      * Do not have multiple chromosomes and do not go through recombination during cell replication.

 - What is horizontal gene transfer?

 - What is a chromosome?

 - What is a eukaryote?

What is a eukaryote?

  A eukaryote is a living organism whose cells have nuclei.
  Humans are eukaryotes.

What is horizontal gene transfer?

  The transfer of DNA from parents to offspring is known as vertical gene transfer.

  Any other form of DNA transfer is called horizontal gene transfer.

  Different mechanisms of bacterial horizontal gene transfer:

    * Transformation: bacteria take up free DNA from the environment.

    * Conjugation: direct transfer of DNA (usually plasmids) from one bacterial cell to another through a physical connection.

    * Transduction: DNA transfer from bacterial virus (bacteriophages) to bacteria during infection.

    * Homologous recombination: DNA exchanged between two DNA regions that are similar in sequence (homologous).

What is a plasmid?

  A plasmid is a small, circular, double stranded DNA, that is not chromosomal DNA.

  A plasmid can replicate itself independently.

  A plasmid can be transferred between bacterial cells through a physical connection.

 - What is horizontal gene transfer?

 - What is a chromosome?

What is a chromosome?

  Chromosomes carries most genetic information of a living organism.

  It's a genetic blueprint that determines what this organism is.

  Chromosomes in bacteria are circular, made of DNA. Chromosomes in eukaryotes are linear, made of DNA and proteins.
