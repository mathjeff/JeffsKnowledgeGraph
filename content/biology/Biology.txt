What is phage therapy?

  Phage therapy is the idea of using a bacteriophage to help a human to fight bacteria.

 - What is a bacteriophage?

 - What is a bacteria?

How can phage therapy be helpful?

  Phage therapy can potentially fight pathogenic bacteria, even when those bacteria are resistant to antibiotics.

  Phage therapy can also avoid harming non-pathogenic bacteria.

How can non-pathogenic bacteria be good?

  Non-pathogenic bacteria can discourage pathogens from colonizing the human body.

  Non-pathogenic bacteria in the gut can help with digestion.

What are antibiotics?

  Antibiotics are molecules that are more dangerous to many bacteria than they are dangerous to humans (bleach isn't considered an antibiotic because it's also dangerous to human cells).

 - What is a bacteria?

How can antibiotics be helpful?

  Antibiotics are useful for killing pathogenic bacteria that have infected a human.

What is a pathogen?

  A pathogen is an entity that causes disease.

What is antibiotic resistance?

  Antibiotic resistance is the property where a bacteria resists an antibiotic.

What is a bacteria?

  A bacteria is a small organism that consumes energy and reproduces

What is a bacteriophage?

  A [bacteriophage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage) is a type of virus that infects bacteria and archaea.

 - What is a virus?

 - What is a bacteria?

What is a virus?

  A virus is a small entity that:

   1. Contains DNA or RNA
   1. Attempts to infect a living cell
   1. Gets living cells to make more copies of it
   1. Leaves that living cell
   1. Repeats the process again

What is a genetic variant?

  Genetic variants are differences in DNA sequences.

  Genetic variants include:

    * Point mutations: single base changes in the DNA sequence

    * Indels: insertion or deletion of a small DNA segment

    * Structural changes: deletion, duplication, or inversions of a long genome region

What is an allele?

  An allele is one variant form of a gene. A gene can have many variant forms, leading to different genotypes for that gene.

  Alternatively an allele is a version of coding DNA sequence (CDS) at a specific chromosomal position (locus).

 - What is a genetic variant?

 - What is the genotype?

 - What is the phenotype?

 - What is a locus?

What is a genome?

  Genome of an individual organism is the complete set of DNA (genetic material) in that organism.

What is a metagenome?

  A metagenome is a collection of genomes from different individual organisms, sometimes from different species.

 - What is a genome?

What is a pangenome?

  Pangenome of a species is all the unique genes you can find for it.

  Pangenome can be divided into a core genome, with genes present in all or most your samples, and an accessory genome, with genes present in only a fraction of your sampled population.

 - What is a genome?

What is the genotype?

  The genotype of an organism is its complete set of genetic material. Genotype can also be used to refer to the alleles an individual carries for a particular gene.

 - What is a trait?

What is the phenotype?

  The phenotype of an organism is its set of observable characteristics.

  Phenotype can also be used to refer to the superficial variant an individual shows for a particular gene (trait).

  For instance, blue eyes would be one's phenotype for the trait of eye color. The variants of genes that encoded blue eyes would be the person's genotype for this trait.

 - What is a trait?

 - What is fitness?

What is a trait?

  A trait is a specific characteristic of an individual. It can be determined by corresponding genes, environmental factors or both. A trait can be qualitative (eye color, blood type, etc.) or quantitative (stature).

What is fitness?

  Fitness is the quantitative measurement of an organism's ability to survive, usually translated into its reproductive success.

What is a niche?

  For a certain environment, a niche is like an ecological occupation one or many species can be attuned to. For instance, an environment with a high death rate tends to create a niche for detritivores.

What is a locus?

  Locus (multiple=loci) is a specific position on the chromosome where a certain gene is located.

How do point mutations occur?

  Point mutations usually happen when cells are replicating their DNA: sometimes those cells make small errors and create another genome that isn't an exact duplicate of the original.

  Typical mutation rates:

    * For bacteria: 1E-9 to 1E-10 mutations per nucleotide per generation

    * For human: 1E-8 mutations per nucleotide per generation

    * For RNA viruses: 1E-3 to 1E-5 mutations per nucleotide per generation

 - What is genetic drift?

What is evolution?

  Evolution is the process by which living organisms change over time through changes in the genome.

  Evolution happens because:

    * Different organisms have their own genetic variants

    * Different organisms survive differently

    * Organisms pass their genetic changes on to the next generation

 - What is a genome?

 - What is a genetic variant?

 - What is natural selection?

 - What is convergent evolution?

What is convergent evolution?

  Convergent evolution describes the case in which natural selection leads to the evolution of similar traits independently, in different species/lineages.

  An example can be similar wing structures between flying insects and birds; These traits have different evolutionary history (not inherited from a common ancestor) but similar properties.

What is natural selection?

  Natural selection is the idea that organisms with beneficial genetic changes reproduce more successfully or survive better (positive selection), while those with harmful genetic changes reproduce less effectively (negative selection).

What is a selective sweep?

  A selective sweep is the process where a beneficial genetic change increases to almost 100% frequency in a population, due to positive selection.

  The neighboring genetic changes (variants) can also increase in frequency because they are next to the beneficial genetic changes (hitchhiking).

  Genetic changes that are far away from the beneficial changes are less likely to hitchhike because recombination is more likely to occur in the genomic region between them.

 - What is a whole-genome sweep?

 - What is a soft sweep?

 - What is a hard sweep?

What is recombination?

  Recombination is the process by which DNA is exchanged between homologous portions of two genomes.

  * In eukaryotes, this DNA is exchanged between chromosomes during cell replication.

  * Bacteria

      * Exchange DNA through horizontal gene transfer.

      * Do not have multiple chromosomes and do not go through recombination during cell replication.

What is adaptive radiation?

  Adaptive radiation describes a scenario in which a lineage quickly diversifies into multiple ones during adaptation.

  A classic example would be one species of birds arriving in a uninhabited island, which provides a variety of food sources and thus many potential niches. These birds quickly evolve into several species to occupy these niches, e.g. long beaks for worms, large beaks for nuts, etc.

 - What is a niche?

What is genetic drift?

  Genetic drift is the change of allele frequencies due to pure random chance, as opposed to changes caused by natural selection.

What is a gene-specific sweep?

  Gene-specific sweep is similar to selective sweep, but no other genetic variants (alleles) are carried along during the process, e.g. only the specific gene was able to spread.

  This leads to less reduction in genetic diversity (compared to a normal selective sweep).

What is a whole-genome sweep?

  Whole-genome sweep is a case of selective sweep in which the entire genome spreads across the population.

What is a soft sweep?

  A soft selective sweep describes the case in which the spreading beneficial allele originated from multiple sources.

  This would have a less profound effect on the reduction of genetic diversity (compared to hard sweeps), as multiple haplotypes shall exist in the population.

What is a hard sweep?

  A hard selective sweep describes the case in which the spreading beneficial allele originated from a single source.

What is a haplotype?

  A haplotype refers a set of genetic variants (alleles) that tends to be inherited together, e.g. during a selective sweep.

What is a eukaryote?

  A eukaryote is a living organism whose cells have nuclei.
  Humans are eukaryotes.

What is horizontal gene transfer?

  The transfer of DNA from parents to offspring is known as vertical gene transfer.

  Any other form of DNA transfer is called horizontal gene transfer.

  Different mechanisms of bacterial horizontal gene transfer:

    * Transformation: bacteria take up free DNA from the environment.

    * Conjugation: direct transfer of DNA (usually plasmids) from one bacterial cell to another through a physical connection.

    * Transduction: DNA transfer from bacterial virus (bacteriophages) to bacteria during infection.

    * Homologous recombination: DNA exchanged between two DNA regions that are similar in sequence (homologous).

What is a plasmid?

  A plasmid is a small, circular, double stranded DNA, that is not chromosomal DNA.

  A plasmid can replicate itself independently.

  A plasmid can be transferred between bacterial cells through a physical connection.

 - What is horizontal gene transfer?

 - What is a chromosome?

What is a chromosome?

  Chromosomes carries most genetic information of a living organism.

  It's a genetic blueprint that determines what this organism is.

  Chromosomes in bacteria are circular, made of DNA. Chromosomes in eukaryotes are linear, made of DNA and proteins.

 - What is a locus?

What is CDS?

  CDS simply stands for "Coding DNA Sequences". Self-explanatory. Commonly seen in genomes.

 - What is a genome?

What is MSA?

  MSA stands for "Mulit Sequence Alignment".

What is MRCA?

  MRCA stands for "Most Recent Common Ancestor". A term more commonly used when talking about long-term evolution.

What is epistasis?

  Epistasis describes the phenomenon that the expressions of genes (or mutations) interfere each other.

  This can be related to the amount of mutations needed for a gene to alter function, or related to the amount of alterations needed to cause changes in a pathway.

What is homoplasy?

  Homoplasy (descriptive=homoplastic) describes the case in which a feature that has been gained or lost independently in separate lineages over the course of evolution, in contrast to homology.

  Both convergent evolution and horizontal gene transfer could lead to homoplastic patterns when comparing different genomes.

 - What is convergent evolution?

 - What is horizontal gene transfer?

What are orthologs?

  Genes separated (found in different species) by speciation events are called orthologs.

  Descriptive=orthologous.

What are paralogs?

  Genes separated by gene duplication events are called paralogs (I haven't encountered this term very often).

  Descriptive=paralogous.

What is homology?

  Homology (descriptive=homologous) describes the case in which a feature that has been gained or lost in separate lineages due to common ancestry, in contrast to homoplasy.

  Both orthologs and paralogs are homologous genes.

  The term homology can also mean that the things are similar or the same.

What are isolates?

  In microbiology, isolates are strains of microorganisms that have been separated from a mixed population.
