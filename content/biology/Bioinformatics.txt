Mapper

  Mapper is a tool by Jeff and Anni that does sequence alignment. They spent a bunch of effort making it fast and accurate.

  You can find it at https://github.com/mathjeff/mapper

What is sequence alignment?

  Sequence alignment is the process of comparing two or more gene sequences and determining how they are similar, if at all.

  Two sequences may differ in a few different ways:

  * One or more nucleotides in one sequence may have been replaced by the same number of nucleotides in the other sequence

  * One or more nucleotides may have been removed from either sequence. This is called an "indel" and can represent either an insertion or a deletion

How to install bioinformatics tools?

  * [anaconda or miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)

    Many tools and their required environments can be easily installed this way!

    Can you install blast by conda?

    Answer: `conda install blast`

  * [pip](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pip)

    Many python packages can be easily installed by pip!

    Can you install pandas by pip?

    Answer: `pip install pandas`

How to compare proteins

  * [Diamond](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/diamond)

    Fast

  * [hmm](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/hmmer)

    Based on protein function domain

How to compare DNA

  * Comparing to an existing database

    * Run BLAST online [here](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

  * Comparing to your own database

    * Run [BLAST on your own computer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/howto/run-blast-local/)

      May be slower than some other tools but should be highly accurate

    * [Mapper](https://github.com/mathjeff/mapper)

      X-mer based, fast, accurate, short read only, easy to use

    * [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml)

      Slow, short read only, designed for human genomes, requires downstream tools to summarize genetic variants

    * [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)

      Faster than bowtie2, long read too, designed for human genomes, requires downstream tools to summarize genetic variants

    * [Usearch](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/download.html)

      Fast, nucleotide database only

How to identify genetic variants?

  This process involves using sequence alignment tools to align the sequences to a reference genome and a summarization tool to identify and summarize the genetic variants shared by multiple sequences.

What is an x-mer?

  A k-mer is a short segment of DNA with a fixed length of k base pairs.

  X-mers refers to many k-mers of various lengths.
