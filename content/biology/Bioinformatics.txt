Mapper

  Mapper is a tool by Jeff and Anni that does sequence alignment. They spent a bunch of effort making it fast and accurate.

What is sequence alignment?

  Sequence alignment is the process of comparing two or more gene sequences and determining how they are similar, if at all.

  Two sequences may differ in a few different ways:

  * One or more nucleotides in one sequence may have been replaced by the same number of nucleotides in the other sequence

  * One or more nucleotides may have been removed from either sequence. This is called an "indel" and can represent either an insertion or a deletion
