Mapper

  Mapper is a tool by Jeff and Anni that does sequence alignment. They spent a bunch of effort making it fast and accurate.

  You can find it at https://github.com/mathjeff/mapper

What is sequence alignment?

  Sequence alignment is the process of comparing two or more gene sequences and determining how they are similar, if at all.

  Two sequences may differ in a few different ways:

  * One or more nucleotides in one sequence may have been replaced by the same number of nucleotides in the other sequence

  * One or more nucleotides may have been removed from either sequence. This is called an "indel" and can represent either an insertion or a deletion

What is bioinformatics?

  The application of computational tools to interpret biological data

How can I install bioinformatics tools?

  * Many tools can be installed via [anaconda or miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)

    To install blast via `conda`, run this:

    `conda install blast`

  * Many python packages can be installed via [pip](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pip)

    To install `pandas` via `pip`:

    `pip install pandas`

How to compare proteins

  * [Diamond](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/diamond)

    Fast

  * [hmm](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/hmmer)

    Based on protein function domain

How to compare DNA

  * Comparing to an existing database

    * Run BLAST online [here](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

  * Comparing to your own database

    * Run [BLAST on your own computer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/howto/run-blast-local/)

      May be slower than some other tools but should be highly accurate

    * [Mapper](https://github.com/mathjeff/mapper)

      X-mer based, fast, accurate, short read only, easy to use

    * [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml)

      Slower, short read only, designed for human genomes, requires downstream tools to summarize genetic variants

    * [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)

      Faster than bowtie2, long read too, designed for human genomes, requires downstream tools to summarize genetic variants

    * [Usearch](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/download.html)

      Fast, nucleotide database only

How can I identify genetic variants?

  Identifying genetic variants involves:

  1. Identify a genome to use as a reference
  1. Identify a genetic sample to compare to this reference
  1. Run a sequence aligner
  1. Run a variant detector such as [QuickVariants](https://github.com/caozhichongchong/QuickVariants)
    * If the sequence aligner you used was [Mapper](https://github.com/mathjeff/mapper), it can do this step too

How can I choose a reference genome for sequence alignment?

  This depends on what you'd like to do with your reference genome
  * If you are interested in a specific genome that someone else has already studied, you may be able to find it via [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and download it from there
  * If you are interested in a specific physical organism, you might be able to put its genome into a sequencer to identify its genome

 - What is a reference genome?

What is a reference genome?

  A reference genome is a named set of gene sequences
